yourmuni is a simple app to manage your commute. It lets you bookmark one or multiple SF Muni stops (adding other agencies monitored by nextbus.com shortly) so that you can quickly access informaton about incoming vehicles.

yourmuni was inspired by momuni.com and Paul Hammond's minimuni (http://github.com/paulhammond/minimuni/tree/master)
