yourmuni is a simple app to manage your commute. It lets you bookmark one or multiple SF Muni stops (adding other agencies monitored by nextbus.com shortly) so that you can quickly access information about incoming vehicles.

yourmuni was inspired by momuni.com and Paul Hammond's minimuni (http://github.com/paulhammond/minimuni/tree/master)

yourmuni is written using Django (latest in SVN as of this writing) and lives on the Google App Engine at http://yourmuni.appspot.com (apparently, Google is no longer letting apps use their own domains)
